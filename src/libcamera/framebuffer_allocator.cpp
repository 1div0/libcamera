/**
 * \class FrameBufferAllocator
 * \brief FrameBuffer allocator for applications
 *
 * The libcamera API is designed to consume buffers provided by applications as
 * FrameBuffer instances. This makes libcamera a user of buffers exported by
 * other devices (such as displays or video encoders), or allocated from an
 * external allocator (such as ION on Android platforms). In some situations,
 * applications do not have any mean to allocate or get hold of suitable
 * buffers, for instance when no other device is involved, on Linux platforms
 * that lack a centralized allocator. The FrameBufferAllocator class provides a
 * buffer allocator that can be used in these situations.
 *
 * Applications create a framebuffer allocator for a Camera, and use it to
 * allocate buffers for streams of a CameraConfiguration with allocate(). They
 * control which streams to allocate buffers for, and can thus use external
 * buffers for a subset of the streams if desired.
 *
 * Buffers are deleted for a stream with free(), and destroying the allocator
 * automatically deletes all allocated buffers. Applications own the buffers
 * allocated by the FrameBufferAllocator and are responsible for ensuring the
 * buffers are not deleted while they are in use (part of a Request that has
 * been queued and hasn't completed yet).
 *
 * Usage of the FrameBufferAllocator is optional, if all buffers for a camera
 * are provided externally applications shall not use this class.
