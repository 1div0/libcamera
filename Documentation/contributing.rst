Submitting Patches
------------------

The libcamera project has high standards of stability, efficiency and
reliability. To achieve those, the project goes to great length to produce
code that is as easy to read, understand and maintain as possible. This is
made possible by a set of :ref:`coding-style-guidelines` that all submissions
are expected to follow.

Patches submitted to the libcamera project must be certified as suitable for
integration into an open source project. As such libcamera follows the same
model as utilised by the Linux kernel, and requires the use of 'Signed-off-by:'
tags in all patches.

By signing your contributions you are certifying your work in accordance with
the `Developer's Certificate of Origin`_
